## About

This template is designed for creating monorepo-style Web applications with
Rust-generated WebAssembly and Webpack without publishing your wasm to NPM.

[**ðŸ“š Read this template's tutorial! ðŸ“š**][template-docs]

Be sure to check out [other `wasm-pack` tutorials online][tutorials] for other
templates and usages of `wasm-pack`.

## ðŸš´ Using This Template

You can use `npm init` to clone this template:

```sh
npm init rust-webpack my-app
```

[Afterwards check out the full documentation for exploring it][template-docs].

## ðŸ”‹ Batteries Included

This template comes pre-configured with all the boilerplate for compiling Rust
to WebAssembly and hooking into a Webpack build pipeline.

- `npm start` -- Serve the project locally for development at
  `http://localhost:8080`. It auto-reloads when you make any changes.

- `npm run build` -- Bundle the project (in production mode).

- `npm test` -- Run the project's unit tests.

## How to install

```sh
npm install
```

## How to run in debug mode

```sh
# Builds the project and opens it in a new browser tab. Auto-reloads when the project changes.
npm start
```

## How to build in release mode

```sh
# Builds the project and places it into the `dist` folder.
npm run build
```

## How to run unit tests

```sh
# Runs tests in Firefox
npm test -- --firefox

# Runs tests in Chrome
npm test -- --chrome

# Runs tests in Safari
npm test -- --safari
```

## What does each file do?

- `Cargo.toml` contains the standard Rust metadata. You put your Rust dependencies in here. You must change this file with your details (name, description, version, authors, categories)

- `package.json` contains the standard npm metadata. You put your JavaScript dependencies in here. You must change this file with your details (author, name, version)

- `webpack.config.js` contains the Webpack configuration. You shouldn't need to change this, unless you have very special needs.

- The `js` folder contains your JavaScript code (`index.js` is used to hook everything into Webpack, you don't need to change it).

- The `src` folder contains your Rust code.

- The `static` folder contains any files that you want copied as-is into the final build. It contains an `index.html` file which loads the `index.js` file.

- The `tests` folder contains your Rust unit tests.
